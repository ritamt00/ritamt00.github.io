San Francisco has had a long-standing reputation associated with drug use, dating back to the 19th century. During the 1960s "Summer of Love", the city became a centre for youth exeprimenting with drugs, contributing to its image as a center for counterculture and drug use. 

Nevertheless, in more recent history it has earned a reputation as an innovative city that serves as a cultural and tech hub. However, considering the ongoing opioids crisis (especially with the rise of the use of fentanyl), San Francisco has increasingly been perceived as a city in decline, characterized by zombie-like drug users and open-air drug markets. In 2021, the then-San Francisco mayor [declared](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/san-francisco-drug-overdose-deaths/) an official state of emergency in the Tenderloin district and, in 2023, overdose deaths reached a record high.
 

For our analysis, we are using data published by the City and County of San Francisco about  [Police Department Incident Reports](https://data.sfgov.org/browse?category=Public+Safety&sortBy=relevance&page=1&pageSize=20) (2003-2025, focusing only on complete years 2003-2024). This dataset provides information about crime statistics in the city of San Francisco such as the type of crime, the location and the time of the incident, among others. A quick look at the dataset shows that the year with most crime occurrences is 2018 and the one with least crime occurrences is 2024. The most popular crimes are **larceny/theft** and **assault**.

In our case, we aim to analyze the evolution of **drug-related** crimes in San Francisco's most recent history and understand how these crimes affect the different districts of the city and detect where and when these crimes are most likely to occur.
