In San Francisco, drug and narcotic offenses are a major and ongoing issue. While we [know]({% post_url 2025-03-31-map-crimes %}) that these crimes are often concentrated in specific areas, for public safety and health reasons, it is also relevant to know at which hours these kind of crimes usually happen. Here, we discover interesting trend about when they happen.

We investigated drug – related incidents from 2003 – 2024 and created a 24 – hour polar bar chart to show the timing. The results were clear: incidents start to arise around noon, peak between 2:00pm and 5:00pm and then slowly drop off into the evening. Early mornings have the fewest reported cases. 
This pattern might be connected to a mix of factors, for example, like when people are out during the afternoon, there’s more opportunity for these incidents to happen. Also, police activity might also play a role, because law enforcement may be more visible or active during the day, leading to more drug offenses being noticed and reported. Busy locations like downtown or near public transportation (like BART stations or bus stops) tend to have the most foot traffic in the afternoon. These crowded areas could be hotspots for drug activity because there are more people passing through.
