Data [shows]({% post_url 2025-03-31-map-crimes %}) that drug-related crimes are mostly concentrated in specific areas of the city (namely the **Tenderloin district** and some parts of **Civic Center**). Now, we aim to investigate beyond the most popular hotspots and see how the evolution of these type of crimes has affected the different districts of the city.

You can explore how drug/narcotics crimes have evolved over time in your district in the interactive visualization below. Here, data shows that in some districts like Bayview and Ingleside, the number of crimes has experienced a consistent decline over time. Meanwhile, other districts such as Southern and Tenderloin have suffered periods of increase and decrease in drug-related crimes and have experienced a surge after Covid.

Moreover, data for the Tenderloin district seems to move somehow in accordance with the number of accidental overdose deaths in the city. The San Francisco Examiner [reported](https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/health/sf-in-2024-records-fewest-drug-overdose-deaths-since-2020/article_ac752cbe-d522-11ef-a780-8339eb5592c2.html)  that there was a record level in 2025 for overdose deaths (810) in the last five years. Moreover, in 2023, there is a local peak in the number of crimes in Tenderloin. Furthermore, in 2024 there is a noticeable reduction in the number of crimes in Tenderloin and there was also a 22% decrease in overdose deaths from the 810 recorded in 2023.
