Drug-related crimes continue to be a major issue in San Francisco, affecting both public safety and daily life. Some districts such as Tenderloin have nowadays a bad reputation as epicenters of drug and narcotic crimes, but is this reputation fair? Where are the real hotspots for drug incidents in the city? Explore the evolution of drug-related crimes in the city with our interactive map.

Our maps show that drug activity is mostly concentrated in the same central neighborhoods, especially around the **Tenderloin district** and **Civic Center**. This trend remained consistent throughout the four time periods between 2009 and 2024.

One of the hotspots that stands out (in an area around Market street) coincides with the spot that the [San Francisco Standard](https://sfstandard.com/2024/08/28/san-francisco-drug-markets-post-crackdown/) reported in 2024 as a popular drug market area. Reports state that the open-air drug use problem has persisted despite numerous arrests of users and dealers. With this, we can confirm what the data suggested, that certain areas continue to be high risk zones and public safety concerns remain pressing. Moreover, it seems that the policy of combating the drug crisis with a firm law enforcement effort, might not be the best solution, given that it does not solve the root problem and the illegal activity might just eventually migrate elsewhere.

Looking at these patterns on the map brings the issue into clarity. While drug/narcotic offenses are distributed throughout the city, their high concentration in specific districts suggests a deeper, systemic challenge that is resistant to surface level interventions.
